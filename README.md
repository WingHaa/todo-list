# Todo list

Built using pure Javascript and Web APIs.

I also tried to write it using Pubslish-subscribe pattern (Pubsub). It was quite painful to write as I forget event naming. Writing application's flow down on paper would have really helped.

App come with some default data for show case. Data is keep by using Local Storage.
