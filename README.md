This project was built to practice OOP design principle. The idea was to separate logic of DOM related stuffs and back end stuffs.

I took upon myself to try out pubsub pattern which I feel was over complicated this project a bit. Generally I wasn't happy with naming of some function and events for pubsub. Splitting of codes between DOM stuffs and getting data from BE also feels clunky.
